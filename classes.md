## Classes
Classes are data types
- Boolen: Binary `true` or `false`
- String: Words `Hello`
- Time: '00.00.30'
- Fixnum: Integer Numbers `1, 2, 3, ...`
- Float: Fractional numbers `1.5`

## Method Types
Want to see what kinds of methods you can do?
run `.methods.sort` on a class type to get a laundry list of what you can do.
```
p "hello".methods.sort
p 2.methods.sort
```
Refer to the Ruby docs for details
